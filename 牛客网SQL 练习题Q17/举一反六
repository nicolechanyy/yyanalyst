Goal: How to use sql to select the n highest salary——individual study notes

牛客网 SQL 练习题：Q17 举一反6 
获取当前（to_date='9999-01-01'）薪水第二多的员工的emp_no以及其对应的薪水salary
CREATE TABLE `salaries` (
`emp_no` int(11) NOT NULL,
`salary` int(11) NOT NULL,
`from_date` date NOT NULL,
`to_date` date NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (`emp_no`,`from_date`));

Option1: By using the correlated SQL subquery (Pros & Cons:This solution works in all database but it runs slowest)
SELECT emp_no, salary 
FROM salaries s1
WHERE 2-1 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary) 
FROM salaries s2 WHERE s2.salary > s1.salary)
AND s1.to_date='9999-01-01'

Option2: By using TOP keyword (Pros & Cons: This option only works in Microsoft SQL Server or MSAccess but it runs faster)
However, this could not be runned out (牛客网）
SELECT emp_no, TOP 1 salary 
FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT TOP 2 salary FROM salaries ORDER BY salary DESC ) AS sa ORDER BY salary ASC
WHERE to_date='9999-01-01'

Option3: Second maximum salary using sub query and IN clause
SELECT emp_no, MAX(salary) 
FROM salaries
WHERE to_date='9999-01-01' 
AND salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(DISTINCT salary) FROM salaries) 

Option4: By using subquery and < operator instead of IN clause:
SELECT emp_no, MAX(salary) 
FROM salaries
WHERE to_date='9999-01-01' 
AND salary <(SELECT MAX(DISTINCT salary) FROM salaries)

Option5: By using a SELECT LIMIT statement with an OFFSET clause in MYSQL database
(Pros & Cons: This solution will only work in MySQL database but it might run faster than correlated query approach)
SELECT emp_no, salary
FROM salaries 
WHERE to_date='9999-01-01' 
AND salary = (SELECT Distinct salary FROM salaries ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1, 1)

a.解释：Explanation of OFFSET:  如果offset=1, 即跳过第一行，直接出第二行; 也可以不用offset, 则直接返还 共5行的值。
Skipping the first record that would normally be returned and instead return the second, third, and fourth records.

b.公式套用：To find the nth highest salary in MySQL without using subquery as shown below：
SELECT salary FROM Employee  ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT n-1,1

c.例子： 
e.g. 2nd highest salary in MySQL without subquery:
SELECT salary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1,1

e.g. 3rd highest salary in MySQL using LIMIT clause:
SELECT salary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2,1

Option6: By using ROW_NUMBER()function in Oracle:(However, this option could not be runned out)
SELECT emp_no, salary
FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) rn FROM salaries) 
WHERE rn = 2 AND to_date='9999-01-01'
